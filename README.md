# Cattle-Records
Motivation
Growing up on a family farm, you get to make the decisions. The more data that you have the better of a choice that you can make. Running the calf records through Jupyter might create a trend that you can go off of or tell you more that you can base your decision off of.  
Data Sources
The data from this project is directly from the family farm.
# Processing Steps
The data was collected and standardized in excel which was imported into a .csv to clean up the data. The data in excel was standardized to be able to equalize the age difference between the calves. This was done several times separated by a few days to get a more accurate value for the calves. The 205 weight is a value based on the expected weight the calf would be at 205 days of age. The Wt/DofA is the weight of the calf divided by the age to get the average weight gained per day.
