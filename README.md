# Cattle-Records
Motivation
Growing up on a family farm, you get to make the decisions. The more data that you have the better of a choice that you can make. Running the calf records through Jupyter might create a trend that you can go off of or tell you more that you can base your decision off of.  
Data Sources
The data from this project is directly from the family farm.
