# Cattle-Records
Motivation
Growing up on a family farm, you get to make the decisions. The more data that you have the better of a choice that you can make. Running the calf records through Jupyter might create a trend that you can go off of or tell you more that you can base your decision off of.  
Data Sources
The data from this project is directly from the family farm.
# Processing Steps
The data was collected and standardized in excel which was imported into a .csv to clean up the data. The data in excel was standardized to be able to equalize the age difference between the calves. This was done several times separated by a few days to get a more accurate value for the calves. The 205 weight is a value based on the expected weight the calf would be at 205 days of age. The Wt/DofA is the weight of the calf divided by the age to get the average weight gained per day.

# Analysis
The analysis showed that the weight from 5/15 resulted in a good line of fit in the table Wt/DofA by 205Wt. There was little deviation from the line of best fit due to the coordination of weight at a specific point of time and the average weight gained in that period of time. The deviation of from the line of best fit comes from the error in the weighing of the calves.

The table of Wt by Wt/DofA on 5-15 shows reasonable deviation from the line of best fit. This shows the difference in the performance of the calves, where the higher performance calves are to the right of the  best fit line and the poor performers to the left. The caves that are above and to the right the line are older and beginning to lose their growth performance.
